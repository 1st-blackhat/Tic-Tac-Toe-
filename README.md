# Tic-Tac-Toe

A modern, responsive **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3** — no frameworks, no libraries.  
Play locally with a friend or challenge the computer’s AI in a smooth, minimal UI.

---

## Features

- Local two-player mode  
- AI mode powered by the **Minimax algorithm**  
- Dynamic 3×3 grid created with JavaScript  
- Scoreboard tracking wins and draws  
- Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- Animated hover and highlight effects  
- Simple reset and replay system  

---

## Game Modes

### Local Play
Two players take turns on the same device, alternating between **X** and **O**.  
The first to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

### Vs AI
Challenge the computer!  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which simulates every possible move to determine the best one.  
This makes it almost impossible to beat in difficult mode.
